# Welcome to EDAMAME Technologies
## What do we do?
EDAMAME enhances security for unmanaged devices, including personal and contractor devices like laptops, tablets, and phones or any other machines when they access corporate resources. It does so while maintaining privacy and confidentiality, thanks to a patent-pending decentralized approach developed from critical industrial IoT security systems. With EDAMAME, traditional, cumbersome Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) systems are rendered obsolete. Businesses will see significant improvements in their security posture and compliance, alongside reductions in operating expenses (Opex), capital expenses (Capex), and a positive impact on sustainability.
## For users: EDAMAME Security
EDAMAME Security is our answer to the growing need for comprehensive digital protection. Here's what it encompasses:

- Digital Identity Management: Integration with https://HaveIBeenPwned.com for online identity management.
- Network Scanning for Everyone: Inspired by 'nmap', we've made network scanning accessible to all.
- Privacy-First Management Agent: It can hookup to our "no MDM" platform (see https://www.edamame.tech) to deal with any devices including personal or contractor  devices, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.

## For developers: EDAMAME Posture
When used in the context of managing access to source code, our solution uniquely allows to:
- Inspect every single device accessing the source Code (and secrets)
- Enforce security and compliance up to the edge through Conditional Access Control
- Uplevel security for developers, whatever device they use (corporate-owned, contractor devicesâ€¦) hand in hand with existing security stacks
- Expand CI/CD security to the edge, through automated hardening and posture enforcement
Our CLI tool and github action is ideal to harden and check the security of a CI/CD runner as seen in this Github action: https://github.com/edamametechnologies/edamame_posture_action
