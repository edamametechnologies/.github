# Welcome to EDAMAME Technologies
## What do we do?
EDAMAME enhances security for non-corporate devices, including personal and contractor devices like laptops, tablets, and phones, when they access corporate resources. It does so while maintaining privacy and confidentiality, thanks to a patent-pending decentralized approach developed from critical industrial IoT security systems. With EDAMAME, traditional, cumbersome Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) systems are rendered obsolete. Businesses will see significant improvements in their security posture and compliance, alongside reductions in operating expenses (Opex), capital expenses (Capex), and a positive impact on sustainability.
